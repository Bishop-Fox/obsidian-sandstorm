## thank you

this theme started as a personal challenge. it is still a work in progress.i will try my best to keep this theme optimized and compatible.

i have some features in mind that i would like to include in future updates such as more plugins support, style settings, and colour schemes.

feel free to report any issues/bugs or suggest improvements.

thank you for downloading this theme. enjoy!
